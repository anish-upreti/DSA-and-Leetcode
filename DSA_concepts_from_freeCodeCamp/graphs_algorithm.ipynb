    "Graph algorithms are computational procedures that operate on graphs, which are mathematical structures used to model pairwise relations between objects. Graphs consist of nodes (or vertices) and edges (or arcs). These algorithms are used across many fields, such as computer networks, social media analysis, logistics, and biology.\n",

    "## Types of Graphs\n",
    "Directed vs. Undirected: In directed graphs, edges have directions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Weighted vs. Unweighted: Weighted graphs have edges with weights (cost, distance, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "Cyclic vs. Acyclic: A cyclic graph contains cycles; an acyclic one doesn't.\n",
    "\n",
    "Connected vs. Disconnected: A connected graph has a path between every pair of nodes.\n",
